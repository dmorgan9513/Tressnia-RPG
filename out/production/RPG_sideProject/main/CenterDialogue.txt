A2|AME: My name is Ameliora, but you can call me Ame.@
A3|AME: Welcome to Tressnia.  This is an amazing place full of beauty and adventure, even if you can't tell right now.@I know this is all a little confusing, but as you progress, it will start to become clear, and I'll be here to help you find your way.@
A4|@AME: You may have noticed a few circles of stones surrounding you.  These are your first challenges.@These challenges will test your mind and ability to solve puzzles.  Step into one of the circles to begin.@
G2|@--What would you like to do? (type "observe" to look around or "ame" to talk with Ame)@
G3|** You observe your surroundings. It's dark as if the sun has just set.  The air is cool with a light breeze.@In front of you is Ame and to each side and behind you are stones shaped together in perfect circles.@There's a feeling of emptiness as you look past them into the distance. You wonder how you got here. **@
G4|@--What would you like to do? (type "left", "right", or "behind" to step into one of the circles)@
